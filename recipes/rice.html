        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I used to eat this everyday as a child. This is just rice, cream and salt! 
            It's so easy to make and so filling too! The rice can either be tomato seasoned rice or plain white rice.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The cream I use here in Mexico is called "Media Crema San Marcos" I really hate any other brand of table cream.
            Mostly because they either taste sweet or have a weird consistency. San Marcos cream is plain white table cream that
            tastes amazing either cold or at room temperature.
